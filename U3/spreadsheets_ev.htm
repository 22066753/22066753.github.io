Spreadsheets Evidence</h1>
<p>For assignment 2 I had to plan and design a speadsheet then for assignment 3 
I would have to make the spreadsheet flowing my designed plan.</p>
<p>The purpose of the spreadsheet is to help manage the loan scheme and keep 
track of what games have been loaned out and to which students.</p>
<p>The Main Menu worksheet has been designed so. I have designed my main menu to 
look like this because so it can be easy to be use and<img alt="Image of a plan of main menu" height="265" src="images/Design_Spreadsheet_main_menu.png" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px" width="388"> 
give a good design. I did this by. I will be adding link to the image to go to 
the other page of the spreadsheet. I will plan to test that this worksheet works 
correctly by adding the links to the images and then clicking on the link to see 
if they work.</p>

<p>The Student Details worksheet has been designed so That library team can 
track what student who requested a game and who was successful. I did this by 
flowing instructions from the library team. I will plan to test that this 
worksheet works correctly by checking the data to see if it all correct.</p>

<p>The ‘’Summary of details’ worksheet has been designed so That library team 
can see what game has been loan out the most. I did this by designing pie chart 
base on the data from the other sheets. I will plan to test that this worksheet 
works correctly by Checking the pie chart data from the other sheets is correct 
and matches the pie chart. </p>
