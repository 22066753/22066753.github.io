Graphics Evidence</h1>
<p>I had to design and plan a logo and social media advertisement for my 
Assignment 2</p>
<p>I had to design 2 logo plans for the assignment Then I ended up picking my 
second design:</p>
<p>I have thought about what design I should pick to use in a promotional 
campaign for a new home delivery service. I think It would be design 2 logo. I 
think that I put more effort into designing it. I also like the look of the and 
colour of the design.<img alt="This is a image of a logo" height="500" src="images/Logo_design_2_version_2.png" style="margin: 10px; float: right" width="500"></p>
<p>when I was designing my logo I thought a shield type of shape would look good 
the shape would be blue with a light blue line in the shape the logo will also 
have a image of a computer I will try to centre the image the title is Computer 
SOS I thought cubao narrow font would go with the theme of the logo and the 
title text is a light blue. The text is We repair and sell technology that is 
the same colour as the title the font is norwester. I thought the blue would 
look like the colour of computer code. but after I got my review I change the 
size of the computer image and the font size and font to anton.</p>
<p>I had to design 2 social media advertisement for the assignmets I pick&nbsp; 
my first design for the assignment:</p>
<p>I have thought about what the design that I have pick for promotional 
campaign for a new home delivery service I have chosen design 1 I thought it 
stands out more and has the company's logo added to advertisement and I thought 
the blue background with the white Agrandir Medium text look better the product 
sands out more with explosion 2 added to the advertisement.</p>

design will have the company logo on it the background will be blue with white 
text that fits with the blue background I put in Explosion 2 shape to make the 
product stand out I will put an image of a computer in Explosion 2 to show what 
the company is selling. After I got&nbsp; my review I make the logo biger and 
change the font to comic sans.</p>
