Environmental issues are predominant in today's world. In recent years there has been an increase in actions to help protect the environment and, no matter how big or small, we all have a responsibility. There are many global organisations that dedicate their work to protect the environment and as a member of society you also have a vested interest.
 
In this unit, I will understand some of the issues affecting the environment and why it is important to help protect it. I will also examine how I can personally contribute to protecting the environment, which in turn supports my personal growth and wellbeing. I will work as a group in compiling an environmental campaign to raise awareness in others.
