In This unit I now understand the main technologies and processes behind the internet and investigate how they come together to let me view websites and send
information across the world. The internet and web of tomorrow will be even more powerful, more connected, more intuitive and a more important part of our lives.

This will result in an internet of services, objects and infrastructure (ubiquitouscomputing) which will radically change our lives. For example, smart appliances will
be able to talk to each other, clothes will monitor our health and retailers will access social media to gain insight into shoppersâ€™ preferences. 
I have explored a range of digital devices, such as smart phones and digital music players and consider the technology that enables these devices to share and
exchange information.
