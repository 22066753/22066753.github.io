architecture. I can now create digital graphics,that can bring colour, information and interest to our lives for a wide range of industries.

I have designed, created and tested graphic products I have thought about the creative aspects of the product as well as the technical
(both vector-editing and photo-editing). Once finished, I have reviewed the products,
having obtained feedback from others, and evaluated possible improvements.
