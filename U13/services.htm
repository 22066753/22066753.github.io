<br><img src="images/vodafone-logo.png" style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-down: 10px;" alt="Image of the Vodafone logo"><p>The name Vodafone comes from voice data fone. It operates services in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Oceania. As of January 2023, Vodafone owns and operates networks in 21 countries. Vodafone was launched on 1 January 1985, with its first office based in the Courtyard in Newbury, Berkshire, UK.</p>

<p>Vodafone sponsored Manchester United from 2000 until the 2005–06 season. In 2007, Vodafone entered into a sponsorship deal with the McLaren Formula One team (previously Vodafone sponsored Ferrari in 2002 until 2006), which traded as "Vodafone McLaren Mercedes" until the sponsorship ended at the end of the 2013 season.</p>

<p>In September 2010, an investigation revealed certain details of Vodafone's tax avoidance activities. It was reported that Vodafone set up companies to avoid paying tax. The news of this legal tax avoidance sparked angry protests, beginning in October 2010, outside Vodafone shops across the UK. This meant lots of their shops shut. Vodafone was heavily criticised due to poor customer service and severe technical inadequacies, which earned them their nickname "Vodafail" – a website of the same name still exists. In 2019, Vodafone was rated as the UK's worst mobile network provider for the eighth year in a row, in the eighth survey by  Which? magazine.</p>
