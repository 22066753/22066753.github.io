<h1>Nothing Phone</h1>

<p><iframe width="300" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w1h5ukOqOKs" title="Meet Phone (2)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen style="float: right; padding-left: 10px;"></iframe>Nothing was founded in 2020 and the phone was code named Spacewar. It was announced on January 27, 2021, by former OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei, months after Pei left OnePlus. The phone features a transparent design, similar to that of the company's other products.</p>

You can set one pattern for a work email or one for a personal email in Gmail, for instance, but, unfortunately, you canâ€™t differentiate between messages from different contacts, only calls.</p>

<p>The second nothing phone has an upgraded chipset with the snapdragon 8+ gen 1 chipset phone 2 boasting an 80% improvement on performance over its predecessor. The Nothing phones are unique as they feature an LED backlight that can flash when you get a call or text. <a href="https://nothing.tech/" target="_blank"><img src="images/nothing-logo.jpg" style="float: right; padding-left: 10px; padding-top: 10px;" alt="Image of Nothing logo"></a></p>

<p>The main camera uses the Sony IMX890 chipset but this is actually incredibly similar to the IMX766 from the first nothing phone; the two are virtually identical.</p>
